This 'master' branch used to be a playground for my Google Summer of Code 2008
project - implementation of new history system with support of XEP-136.
Since at that time I didn't understand well how git works, it becomes hard
to track history of development because of bad merges, rebases, etc.
This old branch is known as 'old-history' now, and this 'master' branch will
be deleted soon to be recreated later -- for new reincarnation of this project.
